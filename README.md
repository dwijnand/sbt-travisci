`sbt-travisci` is an [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) plugin to integrate with Travis CI.

Original idea from [@djspiewak][] in his [djspiewak/base.g8][] template.

## Setup

Add this to your sbt build plugins, in either `project/plugins.sbt` or `project/travisci.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("com.dwijnand" % "sbt-travisci" % "1.2.0")

Then make sure to **NOT set the `crossScalaVersions` setting**, otherwise you will override `sbt-travisci`.

Other than that, as `sbt-travisci` is an AutoPlugin that is all that is required.

## Detail

- `isTravisBuild in Global` will be automatically be set to `true` if the current build is running under Travis
    CI.
- `travisPrNumber in Global` will be automatically set to the number of the pull request, in case the build is a pull request build. 
    Otherwise, it will have a value of `None`.
- `crossScalaVersions in ThisBuild` will be automatically set to the scala versions in `.travis.yml`, falling
    back (with warnings) to the value of `crossScalaVersions in Global` if it can't be found or parsed properly.
- `scalaVersion in ThisBuild` will be automatically set to `TRAVIS_SCALA_VERSION` if `isTravisBuild` is true,
    otherwise to the `last` version in `crossScalaVersions`, and so by default, sbt will assume you want to
    develop under the *last* version listed in `.travis.yml`.
- `scala212 in ThisBuild` will be automatically set to the unique 2.12.x version in `.travis.yml`, or
    "no-2.12-version" if none set and "multiple-2.12-versions" (with a warning log) if multiple set.  Same for
    `scala210`, `scala211`, and `scala213`.
- `crossSbtVersions in ThisBuild` will be automatically set to the `TRAVIS_SBT_VERSION`s in `env` properties in `.travis.yml`, falling
    back (with warnings) to the value of `crossSbtVersions in Global` if it can't be found or parsed properly.
- `sbtVersion in ThisBuild` will be automatically set to `TRAVIS_SBT_VERSION` if `isTravisBuild` is true,
    otherwise to the `last` version in `crossSbtVersions`, and so by default, sbt will assume you want to
    develop under the *last* version listed in `.travis.yml`.
* `travisCacheConfiguredLog in ThisBuild` will log warnings if `cache.directories` in `.travis.yml` is not
   configured properly. You can disable this warning by setting `travisCacheConfiguredLog in ThisBuild := (())`.

### Example

Given a `.travis.yml` of:

```yaml
scala:
  - 2.11.8
  - 2.12.0
```

`scalaVersion in ThisBuild` will be `"2.12.0"`.

## Sanity checking a scala version key

As a sanity check, you can stop the build from loading by running a check during sbt's `onLoad`.
For instance, to make sure that `scala212` is defines a scala version you can use:

```scala
Global / onLoad := (Global / onLoad).value.andThen { s =>
  val v = scala212.value
  if (!CrossVersion.isScalaApiCompatible(v))
    throw new MessageOnlyException(
      s"Key scala212 doesn't define a scala version. Check .travis.yml is setup right. Version: $v"
    )
  s
}
```

This will return an error message like the following:

```
[error] Key scala212 doesn't define a scala version. Check .travis.yml is setup right. Version: no-2.12-version
```
